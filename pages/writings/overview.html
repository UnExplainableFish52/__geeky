                <p style="color: aqua;">Hello Fello Lifeforms, Welcome to my first seriously written article. I am glad you made your way to here. Now I am calling this page overview page, or some sort of preview because here I will try to answer why I am writing these , what do I want to write about , future releases and what are my expectations from these and many more. <br>
                First things first, let me make myself clear, I am writing these in my code editor so I am not like fully focused with a fresh mind, things get messy really quickly and it is totally understandable if I make grammatical errors or inaccurate talkings so please bear with me. <br></p>
                <p style="font-size: 22px; color: antiquewhite;">Why am I writing these articles anyway? </p>
                <p style="color: aqua;">Well, this is a nice question, I have lived almost two decades as a human in this world and have gathered some knowledge and underdstanding, and according to what I have understood , Humanity is on the wrong track and this is definitely not good. I am always interested in learning about different civilization , how they progress and where they end up also about their journey and trying to find different patterns in their journey, and I believe we are not alone and we are no different from any other civilization so pls don't be arrogant because you are merely a tenant or an entity for a limited duration, you came , you are staying and you will leave soon hehehehe. <br><br>
               
                I do not want to spit out everything right now because Life is a journey, dear reader , have some patience, it is natural to take time in understanding each lessons and principles. They look simple and easy but they get complex when you actually begin to understand. For instance, you may be enjoying your happy day but then suddenly you realize that you are dying each second and in some seconds to few hundred thousands to millions of seconds you will die, you are temporary and things you believe are permanent are actually not permanent. The only thing that is permanent is perhaps "CHANGE". Everything is destined to change and Chnage is inevitable and ultimate. I did not plan to write all these in this article but it is what it is.
               </p>
               <p style="font-size: 22px; color: antiquewhite;">What do I want to write and talk about?</p>
               <p style="color: aqua;">In simple and straight forward words,  I want to learn more about Humanity, so I want to talk about Humanity and civilization, progress , problems and how to tackle and what things to not do to prevent complete obliteration and try to analyze the consequences of actions.
                Here I want to put another disclaimer that I do not read other people's works so I may not be updated or familiar with their pre established works and knowledge and may struggle in some basic stuff but whatever I do, however I think and perform, it is all natural and instincitve, I am not copying anyone or learning from books or other's works rather I would like to learn and understand from my daily life and world(includes news, all the events and incidents that happen in my life, all my interactions and everyone I know). I am constantly learning and everyone is a source of knowledge and opportunity to me. Thank you all for your help and support , it has helped me a lot and I am very much grateful to you all. 
                <br><br>
                In my daily life, I see a lot of people, I try to take some moments to analyze their story, actions and their consequences, I feel sad because I can not see enough humanity left in the peoples. City peoples are straight inhuman, some people are exception but we need to view on a general scale and here those rare people's efforts are neglected , leaving only bad peoples in analysis. Everyone is chasing money and happiness , this is not very bad, but it gets bad when they chase for only thier success and happiness. This is called selfishness, and spoiler alert even I am selfish at the very moment which is why sometimes I am like, I want to escape this real life simulation and try to be alive on my own. This might not have made enough sense to you but let me explain, do you know why do you have to study so hard ? why is everything so competitive ? have you seen some top elite students or workforces like top University graduates? like MIT, Caltech, Harvard etc, whatever, not just them I believe every country has at least a few hundreds to thousands of ELITE tier students, for example, if you take me , I am a rookie, I am weak and I don't know much, I don't code well , in simple words a work which would take me a whole month to do , the very same work would require something like 5-10 hours for them, that is just crazy , so why dont they do the whole complicated work and we chill? why do I have to study all these crap? it is because how humanity set it up. They deliberately set things up so that people have to use more resources and time than required , take longer and twisted route to success than the simple and straightforward one, and many more. Some examples include: making countries spend a lot in Millitary, who are they fighting ? fellow lifeforms like them? some even fight their own blood brothers and family, making nukes, yes nuclear weapons, who do you want to annhiliate fellow lifeforms and blood brothers again? eg: between India and Pakistan. 
                <br>In short, We , Humans set things up this way such that we don't trust eachother our own blood relatives, family and friends and we boastfully talk about travelling to outer space and searching for extraterrestrial life,civilization thinking that we are ready to handle any potential consequences. Sweetheart, this is not a game, this is reality, one wrong decision and action can absolutely obliterate all our existence. <br>Ok, I got carried away, *deep breath* Lets think about our Earth, Homosapien:sapiens, did you know that you and I are actually called Homosapien sapien, yes two sapien because we evloved again form the original Homosapiens who extincted approx forty thousands years ago. Coming back to the previous point, when you look at the globe, you see some powerful countries advanced in science and tech and well developed with strong military , covering a wide area on the globe, almost feels like they make the complete globe, but they don't, fortunately and morally I and US President, we both have equal rights to exist on this planet. He is not more special than me or anything like that , he is also a human and so am I but humanity established beliefs that humanity can sacrifice thousands to millions of lives in exchange for his life. Why is he special? is he like specially talented? no , there is not a course on how to be a US president, here is how we can make the post less demanding, let me take you to my ideal world which is even better than the heaven that you imagine. In an ideal world, a political leader is merely a dummy, to be controlled by the citizens and humanity. For instance, lets assume I am a president in my ideal world, and then there are some rumors about new policies that are needed in the country for example, citizens needing to have a verified internet digital signature and identity or citizens demanding transparency in government offices and parilament etc. Disclaimer: I dont have any knowledge about politics and how things happen, I just happen to have a general understanding so, this is what I can offer. Now I as a president need to carefully analyze and understand the subject matter with my brain powers, Presidents do have some high intellect people to assit in decision making right? I am not sure and no matter if I have or not , I would let create a poll in the parilament and and among the citizens to hear what they have to say in the topic and it  is not like I would leave the stuff totally on their hands, as a president I would determine the confidentiality of the info and bills to make sure that I am not revealing unsafe info to the public. In our current case, the issue is safe to be shared among the public so we listen to their opinions, in some situations the public may demand something like lower tax and gov fees, this is something the majority of the citizens will definitely agree to do but here comes the role of the president, citizens may show greed or lack proper knowledge in critical fields so relying on their opinions for all decision making is not very prudent.
