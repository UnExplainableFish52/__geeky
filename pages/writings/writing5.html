For most of us, the word Anime is very common and usually means something from perhaps Ghibli Studios, or top popular anime all over the world like One Piece,  Dragon Ball Z , Death Note etc. That is expected and absolutely normal, they all have good story and visuals so it is expected for the fans would enjoy the anime but today we dont want to end this topic here, we want more , this much ain't enough to quench our thirst, right? Absolutely! </p>
                
                <h2>Decoding the Hidden Messages in the Anime</h2>
                <p>Shoot! just googled and came to find out that the plural of the word anime is just anime , my apologies I wanted to mean a lot of different cateogories of anime so I used the expected plural form, let us begin decoding!</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                   "Our Days are but a passing dream, everlasting though they seem. Our memories remain, " <br> - <em>Brook (One Piece)</em>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>Now I actually went through a dilemma , I had another quote "Wake up to reality ... " by Madara (Naruto) it is more of a speech but it is really good to hear and understand so check it out after reading this. That quote mentioned above is not even a quote , it is just an extract of a song from the anime , I liked it so much so made it a quote for myself. Now to someone who is new to this vast domain of stories and emotions might sound little incomprehensible but i can not explain the basics of anime so I assume you have watched at  least a handful of anime series and movies.</p>
                
                <h3> Decoding actually begins</h3>
                <p>Let us jump directly on the topic because it is night time and you are fully aware of my brain performance with respect to time of the day. I myself have watched a lot of anime and became able to understand a few things. Let the decoding begin!!</p>
                Let's not talk about the order of the names and shows I am going to mention here, I am just going with the flow and mentioning the ones that come to my mind first, so here we go. <br>
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Death Note : In this anime, aside from the iconic clash between 2 brilliant minds , I could learn deducing skills, narrowing things down to come to precise anticipations, trying to think like your opponent, like Detective Sherlock Holmes said, after eliminating the impossibilities we are left with possibilities, this is quite obvious so does not even matter who said , but the thing is the strategy and thought process demonstrated in the story is awesome. It also teaches us power and strength drives us crazy and leads to chaos, we are not responsible enough to handle those great powers also this anime made me question, are all criminal bad? do they deserve death? who are you to decide whom to kill and once you kill a killer , are you not also a killer? so you should be killed too, right? a cluster of weird thoughts to go through in your free time, enjoy!</li><br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Dragon Ball Series: This one is very inspiring, gives  you a lot of goosebumps so get excited, its story made us realize that hardwork is the key, you will always have competition, no sky is not your limit, you can achieve multiple breakthroughs, also teaches not all aliens are bad, some are better than us humans to the Earth, I mean Goku and Vegeta came to Earth and saved earth , got married and had a family, vegeta came on a mission to destroy the Earth and now look, he has 2 cute kids, you should be careful while judging someone's heart, you never know what's hidden in the thick layer of flesh, they may be good, bad or even GODS for real no cap, rest think yourself.</li><br>
                    <br>
                    <li>One Piece: This anime makes you realize what your true life is, just jumping on the bandwagon is not your life, it is te default life for those who cannot think, for someone as sharp and creative as you , you should think about your true passion and dreams. Luffy(the protagonist) dreamed to be the King of the Pirates was childish from the beginning , yes all of ours dreams sound childish and hilarious in the beginnig but you should never give up, even if it takes your life , you should feel happy to dedicate your life in your passion,it is why you are here and if you dont follow it you are not alive, luffy says. <br>
                    This anime also teaches you the power of friendship, unity and hardwork, it is not about how strong you are but how strong your will is, how much you are willing to sacrifice for your friends and family, how much you are willing to work hard to achieve your dreams, how much you are willing to fight for your loved ones and your dreams. It is a very good anime to watch and learn from. <br>
                    Have you ever felt or thought like the world is , umm Idk what to say, like the world is not normal, the world is regulated and perhaps "controlled"? Illumaniti ? No matter if you have or have not, the philosophy does not fail. <br>
                    Let us try to break down this into two levels for now and try to understand it more clearly. Starting from a nation's level, we all have heard some iconic quotes one of them is: 
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>" Children are the pillars of the nation's future." - The Matrixxed Society </blockquote>
                    I am not sure who exactly said that crap but what I am sure of is that it is not precise and correct, Obviously, Biology says and for god's sake everyone knows that Children are the future of everything , not just a nation, because the generation needs to continue and none of us are immortal, that is the basic of life, why are they trying to fool us with those not so brightly written quotes or lines? Do they think that we are that dumb and wont  even realize that? YES!
                    <br> Just imagine, innocent teens working hard in their studies thinking that when they grow up, they will support  the country, increase its respect, develop and make it advanced in science and tech just to grow up and realize that they are powerless, helpless and desperate for their future. All those dreams, hardworks and sacrifice for nothing, now that is what they are left with...
                    <blockquote> Our whole life was a lie. - Teens</blockquote>
                    Who has the power then? Did you realize that pillars are the things that are under pressure of the infrastructure, they are responsible to keep things as they are, they are used to make the structure sustain, KEEP THINGS AS THEY ARE, HANDLE PRESSURE & BE a TOOL. (I can not write further, it is your turn now. ; )
                </li>
                Let us keep things cool and move on, we have our whole life to worry<br>
                <br>
                    <li>Dr. Stone: This anime gave me a full recap of how humanity reached this stage, seriously, this is the best sci-fi anime I ever watched, let us not talk about the fact that I have watched only one anime falling in that cateogory , whatever when I say it is good , it is good. This made me feel assured by relying on science, would you be able to create everything from the scratch if you had enough work force and the resources? by everything I mean everything you have seen or used yesterday, comb, car,mobile, house, soap lol the order is so random even i dont know  also this anime teaches you the power of unity and hardwork, humanity is up above all forms of barriers.
                        <blockquote>Every civilization needs to go through conflict, it is universally seeded in all society.  - Sociologists</blockquote>
                    </li><br><br>
                    <li>Solo Levelling: Some people claim that this is an awesome anime while some completely disagree, why people like it? Simple! the writer is very smart and is taking advantage of this generation, by writing the story in a way that every gamer kid tries to relate it to their life and makes it popular in reutrn. A character who is weak, poor and definitely not handsome gets picked as a player in a weird real life game like system. here we can clearly see that the writer is trying to get this relatable to us by making the character initially poor, weak and bad looking, and when this character figures out he is the only one with this solo developing game like system and this system can help him grow stronger, sharper and better, innocent kids are psychologically triggered and they feel like they are the main character and even start to assume watching it makes them stronger and they are actually making progress in their real life. <br> Let's decode it together! People who are below 90 Percentile in the competition are not competitive and they find excues, often lazy and NOT SMART, they struggle with things and are barely keeping up, they have lots of bad habits like cheating, no dedication, no hardwork plus no smart work but living in an illusion, they seek instant and temporary pleasure   <br>
                    How can one become like them then?   
                    Firstly, we need to think how is the main character different from others? does he put in different efforts than others? Yes! the main character has suffered a near death experience, was often bullied, has discipline, dedication and faith in himself, you need to believe in yourself and gather enough courage to tackle all the hinderances in your journey, this is a very obvious and simple approach to success that we all know but can not do. So, let us take the harder path, let us make difficult decisions to get stronger, because luck is not reliable and that is the only way we are left with. 
                    </li><br><br>
                    <li>The Big Bang Theory: Okay, enough of minor conetents, lets talk adult now hehehe. Yes, this is a sequel or follow up story for our beloved Sheldon Cooper or should I say, Ph.D Dr. Sheldon Lee Cooper, or just Shelly? hehehe I like the name Shelly, what about you? <br>
                    In this show (including Young Sheldon), I noticed that though Sheldon's a genius, he is not good at everything, for example social skills, he won a Nobel Prize in Physics and yet he has like very low people to support him. Amy, Sheldons wife is the most supportive women that viewers have ever seen, everyone found Sheldon intimidating, weird and  
                    <br>
                    
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>How to fix the illusion them? how to break the curse??</h2>
                <p> Well, it is simple, dont consider it as a threat , take it as a challenge , you know they say, "What does not kill you, makes you only stronger ", take it like an opportunity that came to you with a price to pay, now that you have payed the price , you shall get the product then, so the thing is the anime is not wrong , it is just good to put people into illusion. <br> I can not promise you inhuman strength or capabilities but I can definitely assure you success if you apply the same idea in your life. Make yourself like a gamer in the system in your real life and actual studying , exercising and socializing increases your real stats, and of course your physical appearance , skills , capabilities and social prestige makes you better person in your life, makes you successful and actually helps you get everything you want and we talked about earlier. So! there is a way to get that inhuman anime moment in real life? well,yes not exactly but you can get close to it and it will feel great.</p>
                
                
                <p>Remember that, it is on you to find motivation and insipration, motivators are useless if you dont have any intentions to grow, so it is on you and anime can be very good way to learn to be emotional and rational and obviously many more. It's 11:15 now and I got to publish this before I sleep so thanks a lot for reading up to here, of course it is on you to keep thinking on these topics because I am unable to give my best as I am not employed at writing these so appreciate what you get lol. Hehehe thanks a lot again😊</p>
